# Epistemic Audit Engine - v1.2 Roadmap

Derived from v1.1 Post-Mortem Analysis.

## 1. Claim Boundary Hygiene
**Problem**: Extractor creates fragments like *"several reports claim At the same time"*. These trigger false H1/H3 flags because they lack hedging markers despite being semantically empty.
**Proposed Fix**:
Implement `_is_claim_fragment` gate in `HallucinationDetector`.
```python
def _is_claim_fragment(self, claim):
    text = claim.get("claim_text", "")
    # Gate: Too short or ends with connectors
    return len(text.split()) < 5 or text.endswith(("that", "which", "as"))
```
*Expected Impact*: Reduces H3 (Overconfidence) false positives. Risk Score -> ~0.32.

## 2. Structural Epistemic Polarity
**Problem**: Regex-based polarity misses structured hedging like *"definitive conclusions... remain premature"* if the key terms are split across sentence boundaries or extraction spans.
**Proposed Fix**:
Augment `_get_epistemic_polarity` to check metadata:
```python
predicate = claim.get("predicate", "").lower()
if claim.get("claim_type") == "META" or "remain" in predicate or "suggest" in predicate:
    return "META_EPISTEMIC"
```
*Expected Impact*: Correctly guards complex meta-epistemic statements from H1/H3.

## 3. Refuted Verdict Calibration
**Observation**: Strong claims like *"significantly improved"* receive `REFUTED` (0.9) if contested by mixed evidence.
**Proposal**: Consider capping confidence for disputed qualitative claims vs hard data contradictions.
*Status*: Policy choice, not correctness error.
